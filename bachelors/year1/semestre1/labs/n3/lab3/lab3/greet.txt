There are three possible ways to play(player vs. player, player vs. machine, machine vs. machine).
The rules are:
Each player has set of words.
Each step is choosing word (or letter if word has length 1), searching this word or letter in opponents set,
and erasing both of them.
Game ends if there is no possible steps.
You get one point for each letter erased.
