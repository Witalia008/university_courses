<tr><td>Russia started its own air strikes in Syria at the end of last month, saying it wants to help President Bashar al-Assad defeat IS and other extremists.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>But Washington has strongly criticised the Russian campaign, arguing that it has been focused on rebel opposition fighters and that it will only fuel more extremism.<br/></td></tr>

<tr><td>Related: How China's artificial islands led to tension in the South China Sea<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Twenty-four hours after Washington challenged Beijing’s territorial claims in the region by deploying a warship to waters around the disputed Spratly archipelago, the notoriously nationalistic Global Times accused the Pentagon of provoking China.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“In [the] face of the US harassment, Beijing should deal with Washington tactfully and prepare for the worst,” the newspaper argued in an editorial on Wednesday.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“This can convince the White House that China, despite its unwillingness, is not frightened to fight a war with the US in the region, and is determined to safeguard its national interests and dignity.”<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>The People’s Liberation Army Daily, China’s leading military newspaper, used a front-page editorial to accuse the US of sowing chaos in countries such as Afghanistan and Iraq.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“Cast-iron facts show that time and again the United States recklessly uses force and starts wars, stirring things up where once there was stability, causing the bitterest of harm to those countries directly involved,” the newspaper said, according to Reuters.<br/></td></tr>

<tr><td>“I advise the US not to make a fool out of themselves in trying to be smart,” Lu said.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>But despite the angry rhetoric coming out of Beijing, experts say China’s response has been relatively muted.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“It seems like China’s reaction – at least initially – has been to respond in a restrained, operational way. The Chinese have absolutely no interest in sparking a tactical crisis or any kind of confrontation with the Americans,” said Ashley Townshend, a South China Sea expert from the University of Sydney’s United States studies centre.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>China’s military buildup in the South China Sea – including the construction of a 3km runway capable of supporting fighter jets and transport planes – has become a major source of tension between Beijing and Washington.<br/></td></tr>

<tr><td>Washington hoped Tuesday’s mission would encourage Beijing to step back from its controversial island building campaign, which China claims is for civilian purposes but critics believe is an attempt to use military power to cement its grip over the region.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>However, Townshend warned that sending US warships to the South China Sea could have the opposite effect.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“I think these freedom of navigation missions may play into the hands of the hardliners in the [Chinese] military or in the regime … It will be harder for moderates in the regime to say no to People’s Liberation Army hawks and others if the Americans are [seen as] being provocative.”<br/></td></tr>

<tr><th>Freak wave caused whale-watching boat tragedy, say Canada investigators</th></tr>
<tr><td>A freak wave that struck as sightseers crowded to one side of the top deck caused the sinking of a Canadian whale-watching vessel, killing five Britons and an Australian near Vancouver Island, investigators have said.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Canada’s transportation safety board said that after questioning some of the 21 survivors, including three crew, it had initially concluded that the Leviathan II sank on Sunday after it was hit by a wave when most of the passengers were gathered on the top deck watching sea lions.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Related: Whale boat disaster: 'people opened their homes for the survivors'<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“We know that most passengers were on the top deck on the port side,” said Marc-André Poisson, the board’s director of marine investigations. “This would have raised the centre of gravity, affecting the vessel’s stability. We also know that the sea conditions were such that a wave approached from the starboard quarter ... We know that the vessel broached and then capsized.”<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Earlier in the day the British Columbia coroner said that all of those killed had been standing on the open top deck of the 20-metre long vessel, which had sailed from the small resort town of Tofino on a routine sightseeing trip.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Poisson stressed they were early findings and final conclusions could take months. “None of this preliminary information should be used in isolation to draw any conclusions at this point,” he said.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>However, the speed at which the transportation safety board reached its initial assessment suggests it has little doubt about the cause of the tragedy. Local fishermen and others who work on the seas around Tofino had already reached a similar conclusion, saying that a wave appeared the most likely explanation.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>The board’s announcement will raise questions about the design of the vessel, which had two decks for better viewing and a relatively shallow draft. The Leviathan II’s owner, Jamie Bray, said it had made the same trip every day for 20 years without incident and the skipper had 18 years’ experience.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>The transportation safety board’s announcement came a few hours after the coroner released the names of the five Britons who were killed. Stephen Thomas of Swindon was the youngest of the victims. Aged just 18, with Down’s syndrome, he had been indulging his passion for photography when the sinking claimed his life.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Stephen’s father, David, died with him. The 50-year-old, a committed Christian who worked for Microsoft, was described as a “huge supporter” by the Down’s Syndrome Association, which also said Stephen Thomas “was a very talented young man and a gifted photographer” who won a national competition with a picture of a lake.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Related: Fifth British victim in whale boat disaster named<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>The Swindon Advertiser quoted Stephen’s brother, Paul, as saying that their mother, Julie, survived the ordeal with minor injuries and was in hospital. Paul Thomas was travelling to Canada to be with her.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>The eldest of the victims was Jack Slater, 76, who was originally from Salford but settled in Toronto. His daughter, Michele Slater Brown, said on her Facebook page that “our hearts are broken today”.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“Our dad was larger than life – a charmer, handsome, entrepreneur, engineer in the Navy, he was 76 years old, he was our dad, our lovely dad, I will miss him forever but I’m grateful for all the times I spent with him, I love you dad,” she wrote.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Slater was on board the Leviathan II with his wife Marjorie, who was rescued and taken to hospital.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>The fourth victim named was 29-year-old Katie Taylor who was born in the UK but resided in Whistler, a Canadian ski resort. The fifth victim was named as Nigel Hooker, 63, from Southampton.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>On Tuesday police resumed their search for a sixth person, a 27-year-old Australian man from Sydney. It was believed he had been travelling with his girlfriend who was the daughter of one of the Britons who died.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Matt Brown, coroner for the island region of British Columbia, said none of the five who died had been wearing lifejackets, although they were available.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“Lifejackets were on board. I believe that this vessel can occupy up to 50 individuals. There were 27 on board and there were lifejackets available for all of them,” he said.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>The British consul general in Vancouver, Rupert Potter, went to Tofino to assist survivors who lost relatives. He described the response of the community as “really remarkable”.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“What always strikes me in these situations is the bravery that people show, and that’s definitely been the case here – how they manage to continue coping when they’ve had such loss,” he said.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Potter, who also visited survivors in hospital, said loved ones were travelling to the town from the UK..<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>The premier of British Columbia, Christy Clark, visited the town on Tuesday and praised the rescue effort led by fishermen from an indigenous community of the Ahoushat First Nation a few miles to the north. “More lives would have been lost if not for the Ahoushat First Nation. We’re all incredibly grateful,” she said.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Although there was not time for a distress call before the boat sank, one of the crew found a flare in the water and fired it. It was spotted by fishermen who raised the alarm by radio and then set off to rescue survivors. The radio call was also picked up in Tofino from where boats also put to sea.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Among the first on the scene was Clarence Smith, from the Ahoushat First Nation, who found the vessel mostly underwater with just its bow still above the waves, held up by trapped air. “We saw three people in the water. One guy was clinging to the boat so we picked him first. Then I heard these voices. There were two ladies in the water clinging to each other,” he said.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Smith said one of the women was pregnant and another person had a broken leg. The rescuers described people covered in diesel fuel and injured from being thrown against steel bulkheads as the sightseeing boat turned over.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Ken Lucas was working with Smith. He said one of the people they rescued was a member of the crew who said the boat had been hit by a wave. Fishermen described a heavy swell in the area during the rescue.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Francis Campbell, driving a water taxi, was also early on the scene. He pulled eight survivors from the frigid water. “It’s something you really can’t describe. It’s going to be held with me for the rest of my life,” he said.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>The flare was also spotted by Peter Frank, who rescued people clinging to a life raft that had run on to rocks. “There was this one guy saying: ‘My wife, my wife. She doesn’t know how to swim. She isn’t a great swimmer,’” he told CBC.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“Some of them, when they hopped on the boat, it was just a sense of relief … I did my best to reassure them, to tell them they’re OK.”<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>About 30 boats responded to the rescue call alongside the Canadian coast guard. All 21 of the survivors had been picked up by the time the official vessels arrived. Ambulances met them on Tofino’s waterfront.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>The fishermen also brought the dead to shore. Survivors were taken to Tofino’s small hospital. But it soon became overwhelmed and so local residents began taking the less serious cases into their homes.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Tofino’s mayor, Josie Osborne, praised the townspeople. “This community’s response has been nothing short of phenomenal,” she said. “People opened their homes to keep the survivors warm and comfort them.”<br/></td></tr>

<tr><td>He believes one of the most interesting things about the architecture in Caracas is “the mix of cultures reflected in the buildings – from reinterpretations of the country’s native architecture to the styles which were adopted after the arrival of the Spanish. This results in a city of contrasts, where architectural treasures are hidden in the streets.”<br/></td></tr>

She was arrested in the mall, and the earrings were found in her pocket, the report says.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>She is also wanted on a warrant for a similar offence by the sheriff’s office in North Carolina, and will face extradition, police said.<br/></td></tr>

<tr><td>“We would look forward to obtaining her release and having her medical needs addressed as soon as possible,” he wrote in an email Tuesday. “When that has occurred we can make a determination on how to proceed.”<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>The daughter of an illiterate coal miner, Payne was born in Slab Fork, West Virginia. When she was 23, she walked out of a Pittsburgh jewellery store with a diamond valued at $22,000, kicking off a criminal career that would land her behind bars multiple times, including a nearly five-year prison stint in Colorado, she told The Associated Press in 2005.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>She developed a winning strategy — dressing nicely, carrying a designer handbag and arming herself with a detailed story — that she used to charm jewelry store employees.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Faced with a well-to-do woman with money to spend, store employees would relax their rules and bring out multiple high-value pieces at once, and Payne would quickly slip the expensive baubles on and off until the employee lost track and she could easily leave with one in hand.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Through the years, authorities have said she has used at least 22 aliases and probably got away with her crimes more often than she got caught. The Jewelers’ Security Alliance, an industry trade group, sent out bulletins as early as the 1970s warning about her.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Payne is truly in a league of her own in the pantheon of jewel thieves, Jewelers’ Security Alliance president John J Kennedy said: “It’s extraordinarily rare for a criminal to have that lengthy of a career.”<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“Usually they either stop because they have enough money and they don’t want the risk anymore, or they’re dead.”<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>In a 2005 jailhouse interview with The Associated Press in Las Vegas, Payne remembered her exploits with amusement, throwing back her head and laughing. She stole diamonds because they were easiest, she said, and she was in it for the game, not the money.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“I’ve had regrets, and I’ve had a good time,” she told the AP.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>She also said in that interview that she was done stealing — at age 75, it was time to stop. Multiple arrests later, in the summer of 2013, she told Matthew Pond, a documentary filmmaker who had chronicled her life,that she wouldn’t steal again, according to a report in the Los Angeles Times two years ago.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Kennedy, for one, wasn’t surprised to hear about her latest arrest.<br/></td></tr>

<tr><td>But his main message to London and Europe centred on border security and the assertion of Western civilisation. Abbott urged Europe to emulate Thatcher’s style, because Thatcher shaped the world rather than passively responding to events.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“Her focus, were she still with us, would be the things of most consequence, managing the nation-changing, culture-shifting population transfers now impacting on ­Europe; winning the fight in Syria and Iraq which is helping to drive them; and asserting Western civilisation against the challenge of militant Islam.”<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Under Abbott, Australia adopted a strict border control system, turning away boats carrying migrants and refugees before they reached the country’s shores.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>In his speech, Abbott, a former trainee priest, argued against the Christian tenet of love thy neighbour when it comes to asylum seekers.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“Implicitly or explicitly, the imperative to love your neighbour as you love yourself is at the heart of every Western polity … but right now this wholesome instinct is leading much of Europe into catastrophic error,” Abbott said.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Using arguments familiar to Australians, Abbott said that once refugees arrive in Europe and in Australia, they have crossed a number of borders and “however desperate, almost by definition, they are economic migrants”.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>'People smuggling is a global problem, and Australia is the only country that has defeated it'<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“While prime minister, I was loath to give public advice to other countries whose situations are different, but because people smuggling is a global problem, and because Australia is the only country that has successfully defeated it, twice under conservative governments, our experience should be studied.”<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Abbott said Australia’s border policies required “some force”.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“It will require massive logistics and expense; it will gnaw at our consciences — yet it is the only way to prevent a tide of humanity surging through Europe and quite possibly changing it forever,” he said.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“We are rediscovering the hard way that justice tempered by mercy is an exacting ideal, as too much mercy for some necessarily undermines justice for all.”<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>He added: “No country or continent can open its borders to all comers without fundamentally weakening itself. This is the risk that the countries of Europe now run through misguided altruism.”<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>He also urged European governments to be vigilant with home-grown terrorism.<br/></td></tr>

But in the summer its size shrank to a negligible few hundred disgruntled souls and was considered by most to be on its way out. Many supporters were said to have been put off by Facebook images of Bachmann posing as Hitler that went viral. But in recent weeks the movement has been given a fresh lift by the refugee crisis, not least by the uncertainty and fears as to how it might develop.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>To some extent the concerns of those gathered in the square are little different to those heard elsewhere in Germany – namely how many people are still to arrive and how they are to be housed and integrated. Neither do Pegida’s demands – among them the suspension of Schengen agreement and a freeze on the admission of asylum seekers – seem out of step with the public discourse at a time when estimates say between 1 million and 1.5 million refugees are expected by the end of December.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>But it is the hate with which most “pegistas” – as they’ve been nicknamed, or “patriots” as Bachmann prefers to call them – are brimming that is the standout factor. That and their strong, almost overpowering, sense of victimhood.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>The wrath at Pegida rallies is reserved almost exclusively for Angela Merkel, who is repeatedly referred to as a “traitor of the people”. The German chancellor – whom many hold responsible for the crisis, namely for her “open door” policy towards asylum claims – is depicted as everything from a euro dictator, dressed in a Nazi-style uniform with red arm bands showing euro signs instead of swastikas, to a state security informant called Erica.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>In between speeches the crowds chant “Merkel raus!” (Merkel out), “Widerstand” (resistance) and “Wir sind das Volk” (We are the people) – a rallying cry stolen from the 1989 dissident protests that were crucial in bringing down the Berlin Wall. Alongside German flags, scores are waving what under the bright lights initially looks like the Norwegian flag but is the black, red and gold cross emblem of the Nazi resistance movement led by Claus von Stauffenberg – who was executed after his failed attempt to assassinate Hitler on 20 July 1944.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“We are resistance fighters like him,” an elderly woman trying to push a bike through the crowds says. “We have hardly ever been so vulnerable in our history as we are now, with the borders open and everyone and anyone, including suicide bombers and economic freeloaders, pouring in.” Like many here, she declines to give her name or any other details that might identify her.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Just how much the movement has polarised Dresden, Ulrich Wolf can testify. Having worked as a reporter with the Sächsische Zeitung for 11 years, he has spent the last 12 months focussing almost solely on Pegida. He has received plenty of hate mail and threats and even had to block friends from his Twitter account. An entire wall in his office is taken up with a chart detailing the Pegida kingpins, and their various connections to far-right groupings around Europe.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“A year in, the topic of Pegida has crept into every family, every workplace, every sports club, you name it, like a poison. The main question being asked is are you for or against it?” he says, over lunch in his newspaper’s canteen. “If it’s a Monday, it’s raining and you’re riding the tram, you can’t help but ask whether the person sitting opposite you is going to the rally.”<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>He defines the protesters as the “verbitterte Mitte”, the embittered centre, who lost their sense of “Heimat”, or belonging, when communism collapsed and have never found it again. Many, he says, work in the service industry, often in call centres or logistics firms, on low wages, which only adds to their sense of humiliation.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“This region is something of a low-wage test lab. People are often not represented by a trade union. Neither do they belong to a church. They’ve seen industry around them collapse, the local fire brigade is no longer financed,” Wolf says.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Related: Daily life of refugees in Germany – in pictures<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>For many their strongest sense of belonging until now came from the football club Dynamo Dresden. Many of Pegida’s rallying cries, such as “liar press”, were heard in the stands there long before the Monday demonstrations began.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Had the refugee situation not exploded as it has, Wolf strongly believes the organisation might have died a death. “But instead it has had a lot of oil added to its flames,” he says. While some were put off by Bachmann’s Hitler impersonation, most now brush the incident off, saying it was indicative of the way the group is victimised by the media.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Since the early rallies, which consisted of little more than a caravan, a microphone, and a few muffled speakers, the events have grown in stature and sophistication. Now the sound system is loud and clear, the event is live-streamed to about 15,000 people, and Bachmann’s language has changed. He started off talking of “asylum seekers”, which became “asylum spongers”, and now he is frequently heard saying “invaders”. In the same breath he will often talk of criminals and rapists. “He moves in steps,” Wolf notes.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Bachmann is under criminal investigation for his inflammatory language and last week came under fire for putting on stage the German-Turkish author Akif Pirinçci who said it was a shame that “concentration camps are no longer in operation”. The week before, a man turned up with a mock gallows from which hung a noose reserved for Merkel. He is also under criminal investigation.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“Both of those went too far for me,” says the woman pushing her bike. “Though the gallows was only small. No one would have noticed it had it not been put on the internet.” Asked why she continues to come to the rallies, she replies: “Because something’s got to be done.” Her husband joins in the cries of “Widerstand!” and she nestles her head on his shoulder.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>But as it has evolved, the Pegida rhetoric has been increasingly blamed for stoking anti-immigrant sentiment across the country, including goading into action those behind the hundreds of arson attacks that have taken place on asylum seekers’ homes this year.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>The justice minister, Heiko Maas, was quick to make the connection following the race-motivated stabbing of Cologne mayoral candidate Henriette Reker 10 days ago, when he said: “There’s no excusing those who choose to follow gallows and Hitler moustaches. Pegida is sowing the hate that leads to violence.”<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>While the tourist office says numbers of visitors to Dresden are down considerably owing to Pegida and the universities and business leaders talk of academics and foreign investors being put off, there is much fulminating over how the city should deal with the group. An online campaign called #IchBinDresden (I am Dresden) has been launched, with figureheads declaring: “I am one of more than 500,000 Dresdeners who don’t go to Pegida. But so far it has had little effect.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Related: Thousands gather in Dresden for anniversary of Pegida movement<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“We are at a loss to find the right recipe to effectively oppose Pegida,” Silvio Lang, spokesman of the association “Nazi Free Dresden” admits. He was among those who criticised the mayor, Dirk Hilbert, for going on holiday rather than joining a counter-demonstration on Pegida’s first birthday.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Timo Lochocki, an analyst of European populism and fellow at the German Marshall Fund thinktank, says Pegida’s presence had been sharpened by the fact that its political goals have become far more clearly defined since the refugee crisis took off.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“The supporters feel that there’s no conservative party any more, that their nation is being sold out, either to the EU or to migrants. An anti-establishment feeling is growing, with a sense of ‘them up there’ doing what they want, while those down below feel they’re increasingly losing control,” he says.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>He adds it is only necessary to consider how radically Germany has changed over the past 20 years to understand the sentiments. “It’s far more open, more European, more multicultural, and within just a matter of weeks Germany has thrown its migration politics of decades out the window. The psychological impact this is having on people is completely understandable.”<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>The next six months will be crucial, Lochocki says. “If the government can give people the feeling they are in control again, that those who should protect them are doing so, that might take the wind out of the sails of the protest. But I do not believe the far right is strong enough to turn this to their advantage.”<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Klein, the opera-goer, says she and her daughter are among many Dresdeners to have fallen out over Pegida.<br/></td></tr>

They include the bombing of a car park at Madrid airport by ETA militants on 30 December2006 in which two Ecuadorian men died.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>The judge said the investigation has focused on the suspected leaders of ETA during this period, since they “had knowledge of the plan of the crimes that were carried out” and had issued instructions.<br/></td></tr>

<tr><td>Aiming to raise awareness of the city’s worsening sexual harassment statistics, the comics first appeared at the weekend as part of a campaign called “What will you do?”<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>According to the UN, 99.3% of women in Egypt are victims of sexual harassment, with 91% saying they feel insecure in the streets as a result.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>The crime is not properly defined under Egyptian law, making prosecuting difficult and often resulting in women being blamed for the harassment they’ve suffered.<br/></td></tr>

State schools may not charge fees, but the cost of uniforms and stationary is prohibitive, even at around $5 a month. Figures show that of the country’s 8,000 early years and primary schools only 1,200 are run by the government. The remainder are private or owned by missions.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>When children reach secondary school age they sometimes also hit financial barriers because of corruption.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“Teachers will ask you to pay for school books, pamphlets and ask you to come in on Saturday for extra lessons and if you don’t they will fail you,” explains Moses Kamara, a spokesman for Street Child in Freetown. “My fear is they have reached the stage where schooling becomes very expensive.”<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Zainab Kamara has slipped through the net in the panic that engulfed the country last year. When the burial team arrived to take her parents’ corpses away, no one documented the children left behind. Childcare and education were not considered a priority.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Standing beside her mattress, Kamara outlines the cost of education – $11 a week for school fees, an outlay of $4 for the four-year-old’s uniform and $6 for the 12-year-old’s. Then there is stationary and the cost of getting to school, a 45-minute walk away. A four-year-old, she points out, cannot walk that far and back each day.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Figures from the UN children’s agency, Unicef, show more than 230,000 children were not attending school prior to Ebola and there are now fears that many more are missing out.<br/></td></tr>

<tr><td>The HTF is made up of a synthetic thermal oil solution that is pumped towards a heat tank containing molten sands that can store heat energy for three hours, allowing the plant to power homes into the night. The mirrors are spaced in tier formations, to minimise damage from sand blown up by desert winds.<br/></td></tr>

<tr><td>But even as the first phase of the project nears completion, Morocco is eyeing grander international ambitions. “We are already involved in high tension transportation lines to cover the full south of Morocco and Mauritania as a first step,” says Ahmed Baroudi, manager of Société d’Investissements Energétiques, the national renewable energy investment firm. But he says the project’s ultimate impact will go far wider – even as far as the Middle East. “The [ultimate] objective given by his majesty the king is Mecca.”<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Whether that ambition is achieved remains to be seen but exporting solar energy could have stabilising effects within and between countries, according to the Moroccan solar energy agency (Masen). Talks are ongoing with Tunisia, and energy exports northwards across the Mediterranean remain a key goal, despite the collapse in 2013 of the Desertec project, a German plan to source 15% of Europe’s energy from North African desert solar by 2050.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“We believe that it’s possible to export energy to Europe but first we would have to build the interconnectors which don’t yet exist,” said Maha el-Kadiri, a Masen spokeswoman. “Specifically, we would have to build interconnections, which would not go through the existing one in Spain, and then start exporting.”<br/></td></tr>

<tr><td>Japan initially said it would abide by the ruling in the Hague. In April it submitted a revised whaling plan under which 333 minke whales would be killed each year between 2015 and 2027, about one-third the haul it previously targeted.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>But experts at the IWC said the new program offered no scientific justification for the slaughter.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>In a special declaration, however, the Japanese government recently told the UN that the ICJ’s jurisdiction “does not apply to ... any dispute arising out of, concerning, or relating to research on, or conservation, management or exploitation of, living resources of the sea”.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>HSI Australia, whose request for Japan to be held in contempt will be heard in the federal court on 18 November, said it hoped a guilty verdict in the Australian whale sanctuary case would prompt authorities to take action if Japan goes ahead with this season’s hunt.<br/></td></tr>

<tr><td>“If the hunt goes ahead, we would expect our government to consider legal, trade and other options against Japan. The policy of the current government is the same as its predecessor – that whaling must end – but the issue is the degree to which it is prepared to put that into action.”<br/></td></tr>

<tr><th>Afghanistan's female marathon runner defies danger to go the distance</th></tr>
<tr><td>Even if chasing her athletic ambitions were only a matter of physical ability, odds would already be stacked against Zainab*. For two months leading up to Afghanistan’s first official marathon in Bamiyan this month, her fitness regime was limited to jogging laps in her family’s small backyard because running outside was unsafe.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>A marathon is exhausting for most practitioners, but few have to muster the additional willpower to endure the kind of abuse Zainab, 25, faces each time she laces her trainers to venture outdoors.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>In August, she ran an unofficial marathon from the Paghman Valley to Kabul with three other young women. As they entered the capital, they were bombarded with the kind of insults reserved for Afghan women who have the audacity to do anything out of the ordinary in public.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“The children were stoning us, the people said bad words like ‘prostitutes, why don’t you stay at home? You are destroying Islam’,” Zainab recalled. The women had to cut the race short. After that, the father of her training partner, Nilofar, forbade his daughter to run the Bamiyan marathon.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Zainab’s own parents are proud of her running, she said. Her mother does worry about her athletic daughter, though she sometimes joins her running around the backyard, along with Zainab’s sisters. Her brother, a student in Germany, has taken up kickboxing and runs regularly with his friends.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Bamiyan, home of Afghanistan’s Hazara minority, is known as the country’s safest region, and one of the most liberal. It was the natural place to organise Afghanistan’s first marathon, which drew around 35 runners, including Zainab as the sole Afghan woman. About 80 people competed in a simultaneous 10km race, of whom half were girls.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Zainab ran with a Canadian and a Belgian woman from Free to Run, an organisation working to improve women’s and girls’ access to sports. Having arrived in Bamiyan 24 hours earlier, too late to acclimatise to an altitude of 3,200 metres, Zainab knew she would struggle and, at the start line, she had trouble breathing.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>The weather in the Afghan highlands is mercilessly cold in the winter. In October, Bamiyan was already so chilly that few of the runners seemed to break sweat, even under a clear, sunny sky. The marathon course snaked its way over softly curved hills and through jagged gorges, alongside rippling creeks and sporadic patches of green.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Running along vast dry plains, and through tiny windswept villages, Zainab drew attention, but none of it malicious. Herders and farmers on donkeys eyed her curiously. Young children followed her excitedly until they ran out of breath. Some male competitors did accuse her of cheating, even though several of them rode part of the course on the back of motorbikes.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>As she trekked up the last steep hill to the finish line, local dignitaries and about 40 girls who had just completed the 10km race cheered her on.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Related: Afghanistan growing more receptive on women's rights, says British ambassador<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“Bamiyan is a good place for this. In other places, they would be killed,” Bamiyan’s governor, Zahir Tahir, said.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Prior to the marathon, Zainab had received a celebrity welcome at a local high school where students had been asking about “Miss Zainab” for days, waiting for her to deliver a motivational speech for the girls participating in the 10km run.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“They were really ready for running,” Zainab said. “They are really strong. They are faster than me.”<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Zainab was born a refugee in Iran, where her family moved during the Soviet invasion. She grew up playing basketball. She returned to Afghanistan with her mother, three sisters and brother in 2004, and is now the main breadwinner for the family, working for Skateistan, an international skateboarding charity, while studying international relations at university. Her father, a labourer, stayed behind in Mashhad.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Sport has become, for Zainab, a tool to encourage Afghan women to defy cultural norms and assert themselves in society. As part of a generation that hardly remembers Taliban rule, and whose values evolve faster than those of society, Zainab has seen many male figures of authority try to thwart her few options to exercise.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>She enrolled in a girls’ taekwondo club until police shut it down. When she discovered Skateistan, skaters had to assure suspicious local clerics that the Qur’an was recited before each session. Zainab only started running last year, after Skateistan trainers convinced her to apply for a grant from Free to Run to compete in an ultramarathon in China’s Gobi desert.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“When I applied for the ultramarathon, I had one goal: to open the way for other girls in Afghanistan – in other parts of society as well, but especially sports,” Zainab said. Much to her surprise, she and her friend Nilofar were selected.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“They said, ‘it was because of your ideas, not your physical ability’,” she said. Free to Run tailored a five-month training course for Zainab and Nilofar, and flew them to China in May. “My life changed, totally changed,” she said.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>However, Zainab’s participation in a marathon in Afghanistan holds more symbolic importance as it “opens up a large amount of space for other Afghan women to follow in her footsteps”, said Free to Run’s founder, Stephanie Case. “In Afghanistan, where women are largely confined to the indoors, when you run and when you hike and do outdoor activities, you are reclaiming public space,” Case said.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Pushing herself, like most long distance runners, to the brink of physical and mental exhaustion, has taught Zainab a lesson she now applies in life. “Everything is in your mind,” she said. “You don’t have to train a lot. I didn’t have training but I have done it.”<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>But equal opportunity in Afghanistan depends on more than sheer willpower. For Afghan women, straying from society’s norms can be dangerous. A brutal reminder of this was the mob murder in Kabul in March of Farkhunda, a female Qur’an teacher falsely accused of blasphemy after getting into an argument with a cleric.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>The killing shocked women across the country. At the time, Zainab was still training with Nilofar, running in the mountains outside their hometown. “In those days I was so worried, I didn’t go to the mountains. I stopped training,” Zainab said.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Two weeks later, though, they went back out. And, Zainab said, if she can convince her friend to keep training outside, they can shoulder the harassment together. “We’re getting used to it. We shouldn’t care about it,” she said<br/></td></tr>

The worry now is that the confrontation will catch fire, escalate and spread.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Both China, which claims the Spratlys as its own, and the US, which does not recognise Beijing’s sovereignty, have boxed themselves into a rhetorical and tactical corner. With the Pentagon insisting it will repeat and extend such naval patrols at will, and with the People’s Liberation Army Navy determined to stop them, it is feared a head-on collision cannot be far away.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>China’s heated response to Tuesday’s manoeuvre by the USS Lassen off the Spratlys’ Mischief and Subi reefs, where Beijing is controversially building military airstrips and lighthouses on reclaimed land, left it little wiggle room. The American warship had been tracked and warned off, officials said, adding that what it termed an illegal incursion was a “threat to national sovereignty” and a deliberate provocation that could backfire.<br/></td></tr>

And Obama just crossed it.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Having personally failed to find a compromise in White House talks with Xi Jinping, China’s president, last month, Obama has upped the ante. As is also the case with Xi, it is now all but impossible to envisage an American climbdown without enormous loss of face and prestige.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>By deploying a powerful warship, by declining to inform China in advance, and by insisting the US is upholding the universal principle of free navigation in international waters and will do so again whenever and wherever it wishes, Obama has deliberately challenged Beijing to do its worst.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Chinese retaliation, when it comes, and it surely must, may not centre specifically on the Spratlys. There are plenty of other potential troublespots and flashpoints where Beijing might seek to give the Americans pause. In prospect is a sort of geopolitical chain reaction.<br/></td></tr>

<tr><td>China is in dispute over other South China Sea islands and reefs with several countries that are all more or less at one with the US on the issue, including the Philippines, Vietnam and Malaysia. Renewed trouble could flare up in any of these places. One possibility is the Scarborough Shoal, claimed by Manila, where clashes have continued on and off since 2012.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Another obvious pressure point is the Senkaku islands (Diaoyu in Chinese) in the East China Sea, claimed by both Japan and China. In 2013 Beijing upped the ante, unilaterally declaring an air exclusion, or identification, zone in the area, which the US promptly breached with B52 bombers.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>This dispute forms part of the background to the military buildup ordered by Japan’s hawkish prime minister, Shinzo Abe, who set a record £27bn defence budget this year. (China’s military budget is roughly £90bn; that of the US is about £378bn).<br/></td></tr>

<tr><td>“Nigeria’s fiscus is in serious trouble. Whatever way the Nigerian state can recoup lost revenues from oil, then so be it,” said Martyn Davies of market consultants Deloitte-Frontier Advisory.

<tr><th>How many guns are in America? A web of state secrecy means no one knows</th></tr>
<tr><td>The American Public Health Association will join the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence in a national summit in Washington DC to tackle gun violence. They describe the issue as “one of the biggest public health issues facing America”.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>But you wouldn’t know it from looking at the state of gun research.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Ask one of the dozen or so active firearms researchers in the United States, and they won’t be able to answer the fundamental question: how many guns are in America?<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>In addition to a 1996 ban on federal funding for firearms research that is cited as one of the most onerous obstacles to treating gun violence as a public health issue, states have passed dozens of laws in just the past five years that make once-public data on gun ownership confidential.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>The best available data comes from a private survey by the University of Chicago, not the federal government, and that is still an estimate, finding that 79 million US households have guns. Other surveys have estimated there are between 270 and 310m guns.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td><br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“There are lots of holes in actually having any data on the number of guns in our communities,” said Fred Rivara, head of pediatrics at the Harborview Injury Prevention and Research Center and Seattle Children’s Hospital and a firearms researcher for almost three decades. “You look at, well, are people with mental health problems more likely to have guns, or are people with past problems more likely to have guns, we don’t know because we don’t have that data.”<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>States have not made the job easier.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>From Florida to Maine to West Virginia to Wyoming, a variety of provisions have exempted concealed-carry permit data from public disclosure or stopped permitting altogether. For researchers, these provisions make it impossible to study guns within a given zip code or cohorts of owners who might have run-ins with the law.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“The fact of the matter is we know how many people own cars, we know the identity of every car in the United States … Yet we don’t know who owns guns, and we don’t know how many guns there are in the United States,” said Rivara.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“When I first started in gun research back in 1987, we could actually go down to the state capitol in Olympia [Washington] and identify through state records at that point who owns guns,” said Rivara. “That ability was subsequently removed.”<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>As of 2013, 28 states, including Washington, don’t allow access to gun permit records. Some states, such as Vermont, Wyoming and Kansas, removed permitting requirements. Iowa has worked for years to make gun permit data more secretive. Two counties in the state lent the legislature a hand by destroying all permit applications. New York tightened public access to gun permits after a newspaper north of New York City published a map of permit holders’ names and addresses. In the past five years dozens of laws have exempted concealed-carry permits and applications and gun licenses from public disclosure or made them confidential.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Take one state as an example: Louisiana.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Louisiana has the second-worst firearms death rate in the country, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, topped only by Alaska. In 2013, 19.3 people per 100,000 died because of a firearms-related injury for every 100,000 people in the state. That rate is equivalent to 14.7 people dying at a single New Orleans Saints football game (where the stadium seats roughly 76,000).<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>The same year, in addition to repealing state bans on machine guns, legislators made concealed-carry permit records confidential and allowed for issuance of lifetime concealed-carry permits. At its most basic level, that means researchers will never know how many concealed-carry permit holders, including those licensed for life, there are in the state.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>But that wasn’t far enough for legislators in the state. Louisiana lawmakers also made it a misdemeanor criminal offense to release information about concealed-carry permit holders – levying a $500 fine and up to six months in jail for any department of public safety and corrections employee who releases such records, and a $10,000 fine and six months in jail for anyone else who releases that information.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Firearms dealers in Louisiana are also not required to retain background checks or sales records, meaning that if a dealer chooses not to record such transactions there is no way for researchers (or anyone else) to trace guns or oversee the efficacy of background checks.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Some federal data has also disappeared. A firearms trace database operated by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives once used to publicly shame gun retailers who sold to criminals was made confidential in the early 2000s. And the FBI is required to destroy all background checks.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>These state and federal restrictions have compounded challenges for the already-barren field of gun research, which has been barred from federal funding.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>In 2013, following the massacre of 20 children and six staff members at Sandy Hook elementary school in Connecticut, Barack Obama signed an executive order that was supposed to lift the ban on firearms research. Congress, however, turned down the president’s request to fund the research.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>In firearms violence research, this has been the state of affairs since 1996. At a time when gun violence was among the highest in American history, Congress defunded firearms research and passed a provision many researchers believe had a deep, chilling effect on the pursuit of answers.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>At the time, a series of papers funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention became a hot-button issue after scientists began to view gun violence as a public health issue.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>One such paper was co-authored by Rivara in 1993. Gun Ownership as a Risk Factor for Homicide in the Home was published in the New England Journal of Medicine, and found that gun owners were more likely to be the victims of homicide, than protected from it. This research drew particular ire in Congress.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“We have here an attempt by the CDC, through the [National Center for Injury Prevention and Control] a disease control agency of the federal government [trying] to bring about gun control advocacy all over the United States,” Arkansas Republican representative Jay Dickey told colleagues during a hearing on his namesake amendment.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>The rider, stipulating that “none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the [CDC] may be used to advocate or promote gun control”, would stop research into gun violence for the next two decades.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>The CDC, Dickey argued, was trying “to raise emotional sympathy for those people who are for gun control”. Congress also yanked $2.6m in funding from the CDC, even as 1.1 million Americans fell victim to gun crime that year alone (In 2011, 439,100 were victims).<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Even Democrats acquiesced to Dickey’s amendment. Lobbying colleagues to restore funding, New York Democrat Nita Lowey told House colleagues: “Our amendment preserves language in the bill which prohibits the CDC from advocating or promoting gun control.”<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“The NRA opposes the CDC injury control research because it wants to suppress the awful truth about gun violence. The NRA simply does not want the facts getting out. It is no more than censorship. It must be stopped,” Lowey said.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Despite her efforts, Dickey’s amendment passed, and firearms research ground to a halt. Nineteen years later, in the wake of a mass shooting inside a church in Charleston, South Carolina, Lowey lobbied for the removal of the same rider she had once been willing to live with to restore funding.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“Preventing research because you worry about the outcome is cowardly,” she said at a hearing, before Congress re-upped (again) the requirement that the CDC not lobby for gun control.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Now, despite $130m in “violence research” grants awarded by the National Institutes of Health, no studies explicitly looked at firearms. Nor did any of the $59m in grants devoted to “youth violence” or the $16m that went to “youth violence prevention”.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“The lack of research has been so detrimental because not only do we not have the research funding, another thing I think that’s really important is that it’s been a huge blow to the trained workforce,” said Susan Sorenson, a researcher at the University of Pennsylvania who studies gun violence as a public health issue.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>In the United States, researchers are required to generate their own grant funding for projects, including for lab time, salaries and equipment.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“If there’s no funding, that researcher simply is not going to have a job, so they go into fields that are more heavily funded – cancer, tobacco, HIV – simply because they too need to be able, like all humans, to eat, to have a place to live,” Sorenson said.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>As scientists struggle to rebuild a field Sorenson called “nascent”, some surprising funding streams have stepped forward.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>The Seattle city council funded research studying whether people who go to the hospital for gunshots were likely to later be the victims of violence (they are). The Chicago-based Joyce Foundation is cited by researchers as one of the only private foundations willing to provide money for research, and firearms researcher Dr Gary Wintemute donated about $1.1m of his own money to fund his research.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“Better data, and data systems, are needed. Interventions must be evaluated, and those evaluations must help guide further efforts,” wrote Wintemute in an editorial for the Journal of the American Medical Association. “Until we revitalize firearm violence research, studies using available data will often be the best we have. They are not good enough.”<br/></td></tr>
<tr><th>Morocco's progress on food security acknowledged by UN but work remains</th></tr>
<tr><td>Morocco’s progress on reducing poverty and eliminating hunger through a nationwide plan has received qualified praise from the UN special rapporteur on the right to food.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Hilal Elver acknowledged the country’s achievements in boosting production through “plan Maroc vert” (plan for a green Morocco, or PMV), but cautioned that more needed to be done to reach small-scale farmers in outlying areas.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“Morocco’s green plan … should be implemented equally across the regions through effective consultation with local populations and improved coordination of services,” said Elver after a week-long visit.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Morocco launched the PMV in 2008, with the ambition to promote socio-economic development through agriculture. It has two main pillars: maximising production from modern large-scale farms through the promotion of agribusiness and investment, and reducing poverty and hunger through the support of small-scale farmers in marginal areas.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Agriculture accounts for 15% of Morocco’s GDP but is even more important to job creation. Up to 40% of the population works in the sector.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>The figures for large-scale productionare impressive. Since 2008, at least 150bn dirhams (£10bn) has been invested in approximately 700 “pillar one” projects such as mechanisation, irrigation and the use of fertilisers.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Several banks and international agencies have invested – including the African Development Bank, which has pledged $132m (£86m) to support the PMV – and private agricultural investment companies have also been keen to take advantage of Morocco’s potential to export fruit and vegetables to Europe.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) estimates that the agricultural sector has grown by roughly 7% a year since 2008. Exports have risen by 34%, 11% more farmland is now in use, and ambitious targets have already been met, for example to increase red meat production to 500,000 tons a year by 2020.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>There has also been investment in “pillar two” projects, but to a lesser degree. According to ministry of economy figures, 15-20bn dirhams has been spent since 2008 on about 550 small-scale projects, such as helping farmers to diversify their businesses, increase yields and try new seed varieties. Again, the results are impressive. Only 4.6% of people in rural areas were classed by the FAO as malnourished in 2015, compared with 7.1% in 1990, and Morocco met the millennium development goal on halving extreme poverty and hunger two years before the deadline.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“The plan Maroc vert has created an irreversible momentum without precedent,” says Michael George Hage, an FAO representative in Morocco. “It has played a determining role in food security and is inspiring several other African countries.”<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Nevertheless, there have been criticisms that the PMV has focused too heavily on large-scale production, putting the interests of agribusiness aimed at export ahead of the needs of poor farmers in rural areas.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>During her visit, the special rapporteur met a number of farmers and women’s cooperatives in outlying regions such as Midelt, Ouarzazate and Errachidia. “Infrastructure should be improved in remote areas to ensure easy access to markets, and to attract investment to rural areas, while projects that target women and young farmers should be encouraged further,” she said after the visit.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Identifying how young people can be encouraged to take up the profession is key. “People think farming is dirty and low-skilled,” said Mustapha Alkhaouli, who runs a beef and mutton farm on the outskirts of Casablanca. “My friends don’t understand why I want to do it, and in fact I also have to run a business in the city to make enough money. But farming is in my blood, I picked up what I know from my father and I want to continue to learn.”<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>The FAO has pointed out that gaps remain in the provision of technical assistance to small-scale farmers and that finance is often difficult to obtain. With an adult illiteracy rate still stubbornly high at more than 30%, female farmers in particular can struggle to gain official support.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>A number of programmes have been launched to train farmers, such as those run by the Casablanca chamber of agriculture to encourage local pastoralists to move into the production of mozzarella and goat cheese. But trainers say they often encounter hostile attitudes.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“Older farmers don’t want advice,” said one. “They don’t want young people trying to tell them how to change something they’ve done for their whole life.”<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Morocco’s PMV aims to reach its objectives by 2020 and, although few independent analyses of the data have been carried out, it appears most targets will be met.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Problems remain, however. The continuing reliance on a good rainy season for a successful harvest raises questions about how Morocco will cope with the effects of climate change. Moreover, the country has so far been unable to break its dependence on imported cereal (2.8 million tons in 2015-16), which makes it vulnerable to volatility in world markets.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Elver said during her visit that more needed to be done to protect biodiversity and scarce water resources as large-scale agricultural production intensified.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><th>Iran's invitation to Syria talks marks significant shift for US and allies</th></tr>
<tr><td>Inviting Iran to take part in talks over Syria’s future is a highly significant shift for the US and its western and Arab allies, and one that will gladden the heart of President Bashar al-Assad. It will be seen as another sign, following Russia’s military intervention, that things are going his way.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Assuming Tehran accepts the invitation, and it’s hard to see why it would not, it will have a formal role to play in helping decide the outcome of the bloodiest crisis of the Arab spring for the first time in more than four years. As Assad’s staunchest regional ally, it is also reasonable to assume it will be broadly sympathetic to his position.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>It certainly has been so far. Unlike the countries that support the anti-Assad rebel groups, Iran has taken an unwaveringly strategic view of the crisis, consistently backing Damascus while pursuing its own interests. It has provided billions of dollars in cash and loans, as well as advice and expertise.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Related: Iran set to join Syria peace talks after US drops long-standing opposition<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Its military role in Syria has been shadowy but vital, deploying Revolutionary Guards as advisers and overseeing offensives by its Lebanese ally Hezbollah and Shia fighters from as far afield as Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan. It has raised its profile slightly in recent weeks as the forces it commands have taken part in Assad’s offensive against Aleppo. It has also suffered casualties that are starting to be noticed at home.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Iran’s formal position is that it backs a political solution to the crisis, but unlike Russia it has never signed up to the idea that it could end with a “Syrian-led political transition” that would almost certainly exclude Assad. That ambiguously-formulated idea lies at the heart of the Geneva conference communique of June 2012 - the basis for all international efforts to find a way out of the impasse.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“In any political process the role played by Bashar al-Assad will be important,” Iran’s deputy foreign minister, Hossein Amir Abdollahian, told the Guardian in an interview last week.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“We are not working for Assad to stay in power forever as president, but we are very cognisant of his role in the fight against terrorism and the national unity of that country. The people of Syria will make the final decision and whatever decision they take, we will endorse.”<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Related: Who backs whom in the Syrian conflict<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>The invitation to Tehran will dismay Saudi Arabia and other countries that fear – but also exaggerate – its growing influence in Iraq, Yemen, Lebanon and Bahrain, as well as Syria. Riyadh firmly blocked previous UN-led efforts to bring Iran into talks. The fact that King Salman has apparently given way reflects US determination, Saudi weakness and international desperation about Syria.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Riyadh, its Gulf allies and Israel have always feared that July’s landmark nuclear deal with Iran, ending years of sanctions and international isolation, would give it free rein to expand its activities elsewhere. Its possible role in deciding Syria’s future will alarm them no less than what they perceived as conventional threats to their security.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Syrian opposition groups, which regularly condemn the “Iranian occupation” of their country, will also be furious at the news, not least because Sunni militants will interpret it in the sectarian terms that have helped to make the crisis so intractable. Beyond verbal protests, however, there is little they can do about it.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Iran has repeatedly signalled in recent months that it deserves a seat at more tables than it is currently invited to, and that it wants to play its part, on its own terms, in resolving the multiple crises of its own tough neighbourhood, including fighting terrorism. It now seems to be making significant headway.<br/></td></tr>

<tr><th>NHS and social services fail child sexual abuse survivors, study reveals</th></tr>
<tr><td>One of the biggest surveys of child sexual abuse survivors in the UK has revealed a shocking failure in the NHS and local authorities, with fewer than half of those who used hospitals or social services feeling they were listened to, believed or respected.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>The independent survey of nearly 400 child sexual abuse survivors found social services and A&E lacked really basic, essential criteria to support vulnerable children and had not improved in 40 years.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Prof Noel Smith from the University Campus Suffolk, who led the research, described the findings as important and disturbing. He said: “It’s shocking because survivors are basing their views about poor service on these really basic, essential criteria about being listened to, believed and respected.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“You can imagine how if someone is finding it hard to disclose – they’ve been told all their life they’re not going to be listened to – and when they do get help they feel they’re not being believed, that clearly compounds the issues they’re going to have.”<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>The study, carried out with the charity Survivors in Transition, is believed to be among the most comprehensive surveys of victims’ experiences of support services in the UK.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Survivors were asked to rate support services – including voluntary groups, GPs, A&E and social services – on the basis of three criteria: whether they felt listened to, believed and respected.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>The police, A&E and social services were ranked the worst. Two-thirds of those who used social services described it as either “poor” or “very poor”, with half of those who had attended A&E describing the service as “poor” or “very poor”. Overall, less than half of those who used social services or A&E and hospital services felt they had been listened to, believed or respected.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>One child sexual abuse victim quoted in the study said: “In the NHS services I have experienced – four or five different psychotherapists – I have not felt supported or believed and it was suggested I was lying. Almost as demoralising as the abuse and rape.”<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>The best-rated support service was independent sexual violence advisors (ISVAs), who are usually based in sexual assault referral centres or in voluntary projects. Of those surveyed, 67% rated ISVAs as “very good” and 46% rated sexual assault referral centres as “very good”.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>The study found a sharp contrast between survivors’ rating of statutory services compared to voluntary bodies. Among survivors who had used both sectors, more than 70% were more satisfied with voluntary sector services.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>It also found that satisfaction with services had not improved over the past 40 years – despite growing societal awareness about child grooming.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Of those surveyed, 70% said they were abused as children by family members, with the abuse lasting on average for seven years. More than 30% said they continued to be abused after reporting it to a statutory service, such as a GP, social worker, doctor or teacher.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>The academics behind the report urged GPs, social services and doctors to ask vulnerable children directly whether they had been sexually abused. According to the survey, more than 80% of survivors had to proactively disclose what had happened to them – an experience many found as traumatic as the abuse itself.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>The survey results mirror the conclusions of an inquiry by MPs into the Rotherham and Rochdale child exploitation scandals, which found that local authorities had a woeful lack of professional curiosity when dealing with vulnerable children.<br/></td></tr>

<tr><td>The study found 42% of survivors did not use support services until long after they first disclosed their abuse, with many not receiving help until an average of 12 years later. More than half of respondents waited at least nine years.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Smith said doctors, GPs and other professionals were still far behind when it came to acknowledging the current prevalence of child sexual abuse. “As a society we find it really difficult to accept that most abuse happens within the family, and although there’s some latent knowledge about abuse happening within families, most professionals don’t really appreciate the prevalence of it,” he said.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“We’re still far behind. We’re still not engaging with the fact that everyday, typical abuse is right under professionals’ noses.”<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>A Department of Health spokeswoman highlighted that the Ministry of Justice was providing £7m this year to support services helping child sexual abuse victims. A separate Home Office fund of £4.8m was distributed to victim support organisations earlier this year, in part due to a huge increase in demand from Justice Lowell Goddard’s independent inquiry into child sexual abuse.<br/></td></tr>

<tr><td>Last year, Jane, 45, summoned the courage to revisit the darkest chapter of her life. It wasn’t the first time she had reported that she was sexually abused by her grandfather. The first time was 30 years ago, when she was a teenager. But it didn’t go well.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>In 1985 Jane went to her local hospital’s sexual health department, concerned that she might have a sexually transmitted infection. To her horror, the consultant that day happened to be elderly and male – triggering terrifying flashbacks of her abusive grandfather.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Jane says: “I was very tense and reticent to be examined. Because of my history that was a massive ordeal for me. The consultant got really bad-tempered and said, ‘What are you messing about for?’ I disclosed that my grandad had sexually abused me. He basically carried on the examination. It felt like it was happening again. It was a horrific experience – I just wanted it over.”<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>After the hospital visit, Jane went home without any offer of follow-up support: “Social workers should have been called. I should have been brought home. My parents should have been involved. I should have been offered specialist support.”<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Doug, 33, was sexually abused by a man he met at a church festival when he was 13. He waited until he was 29 to seek help after battling alcohol and drug addictions for years.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“About three or four weeks after I came out with it I tried to jump in front of a train,” he says. “Two days later my mum took me to A&E and they basically said, ‘You’re not mental. You’ve had a trauma. We’ll put you on to the right people.’ That was it. I was just left alone with this in my head.”<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Doug says he was passed from pillar to post by the NHS. He was treated for addiction problems and for a mental breakdown, but not the sexual abuse he suffered as a child: “If I was a child and I came out with it as a child then the whole world would be on their backs, but as soon as you become an adult, it’s like you’ve missed your chance.”<br/></td></tr>

<tr><th>Is Frank Gehry really the right person to revitalise the Los Angeles river?</th></tr>
<tr><td>Great cities tend to grow from great rivers. Paris has the Seine, London has the Thames, New York has the Hudson. Los Angeles, meanwhile, has a 51-mile long cement gutter, a linear dumping ground so bleak that it’s best known for providing a post-apocalyptic backdrop in Hollywood movies. In the land of film-lot fakery and pasteboard fantasies, it’s no surprise that the vein of blue that snakes its way across the map of LA, optimistically labelled with the word “river”, is nothing of the sort.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“Landscapes tell stories,” director Wim Wenders once said, “and the Los Angeles river tells a story of violence and danger.” The desolate concrete channel, which looks more like an abandoned freeway than a watercourse, has starred in everything from Grease and Terminator 2 to Transformers and The Italian Job, providing a relentless gulley for nail-biting chase scenes, a raw gauntlet of urban infrastructure at its most brutal. Remember a massive truck exploding in a gritty urban wasteland? That was probably filmed in the LA river. Lewis MacAdams, the 70-year-old poet and activist who founded Friends of the Los Angeles River (Folar) in 1985, once commissioned a montage of film scenes shot at the river. The result, he says, was “an unremitting catalogue of urban isolation and despair”.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>But the sprawling city that’s capable of eternal reinvention on screen is now rewriting the script in real life. When you land at LAX airport, one of the first things you see is a billboard of the glowing mayor, Eric Garcetti, not sitting at his desk or posing with the Hollywood sign, but perched on a kayak surrounded by greenery – paddling down the LA river.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“Welcome to Los Angeles,” reads the poster, “where nature catches you by surprise.”<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>MacAdams and his river-loving chums were similarly caught by surprise this summer when it was announced that the kayaking mayor had invited the city’s premier designer of concert halls and feted international crumpler of titanium, Frank Gehry, to master-plan the entire length of the river. Not only that: he had been working on it in secret for almost a year.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>The news, uncovered by the LA Times, came just two weeks after confirmation that $1.4bn of federal and city funding would be allotted to restore a central 11-mile stretch of the river, an achievement due in no small part to MacAdams and others’ decades of tireless grassroots campaigning. The Gehry announcement, hastily confirmed at a press conference at the end of August at which no actual detail about the project was disclosed, came as a bolt from the blue. It threatened to throw Folar’s carefully laid plans, developed with other local architects since 2007, entirely up in the air.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“No matter how they disguise it, Frank Gehry knows nothing about the LA river,” says MacAdams, when we meet in downtown Los Angeles, a few blocks from the gaping concrete gash that carves its way through the eastern edge of the city. “He’s never shown any interest in it. To us, this is the epitome of wrong-ended, top-down planning. Everything we’ve ever done with the river has been bottom-up, driven by the community that lives around it.”<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>MacAdams arrived in LA from Dallas in 1980 and was immediately transfixed by the dystopian spectre of the river, shocked by what had become a dried-out dumping ground in the middle of the city. “It was totally fucked up in every way you could imagine,” he says, in a gravelly Texan drawl. One night, armed with a pair of wire cutters, he and a couple of friends snipped a hole in the fence near the First Street Bridge, slipped beneath a sign that read “No Trespassing: $500 fine or 6 months in jail”, and ventured down the concrete slope to the flat-bottomed riverbed.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“We felt like we were exploring the moon,” he later wrote in the Whole Earth Review. “The air around us was an unholy din … The odour was industrial. The scene was a latter-day urban hell. We asked the river if we could speak for it in the human realm. We didn’t hear it say no, and that was how Friends of the Los Angeles river began.”<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>So started what he describes as a 40-year performance art work, aimed at raising awareness of the plight of the river. It was once the cradle of LA, the very reason that native tribes first settled here, but it was canalised by the US Army Corps of Engineers in the 1930s, in a spectacular piece of depression-era job creation, after a series of major floods had devastated the city. Since then it has operated as an efficient infrastructural machine with one central purpose: to whisk storm-water run-off out to sea as fast as possible. Most of the time, the downtown stretch stands dry, a gargantuan gutter containing a pitiful trickle.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>It looks more like an abandoned freeway than a watercourse – a raw gauntlet of urban infrastructure at its most brutal<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“I thought all I had to do was convince people the river could be better,” says MacAdams. “But I realised the problem was no one even knew there was a river.”<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Thirty years on, that’s still the biggest obstacle. When I tell Angelenos I have come from London to see their river, they look baffled, as if I’ve got the wrong city. “You want me to drop you off by that open sewer?” scoffs one Uber driver, as we rumble over the Sixth Street Bridge, looking down at the sunbaked concrete gulley where a dribble of water weaves its way between weeds and abandoned shopping trolleys. “Good luck.”<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Under the railway tracks, below the bridge, I find my way down through a sloping tunnel, past a homeless couple camped out in the shelter of a storm drain, and out into the expansive concrete crevasse, feeling the same transgressive thrill MacAdams described. Except, three decades on since he cut his hole in the fence and declared the river open, I am by no means alone. There’s a camper-van of fashion models, here for a photoshoot, along with a gaggle of architecture students, surveying their site. A pick-up truck glides past, taking a shortcut uptown.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Further upriver at Frogtown – recently declared “LA’s hottest new neighbourhood” by LA Weekly, in no small part due to its proximity to the newly-appreciated gutter – the character of the river begins to transform. There are the same steep sloping banks, but the concrete never took hold on the soft-bottomed riverbed of the Glendale Narrows, so nature has duly taken its course. A dense canopy of trees and shrubs sprouts from the gully, as if the natural cycle has been accelerated several decades, aided by a good squirt of fertiliser. There’s even a couple of feet of water, the depth created by the increasingly choked channel, and a cycle path now stretches seven miles up to Griffith Park.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>It is here in fast-gentrifying Frogtown that Folar opened the Frog Spot last summer, a community gathering space on the river’s edge, from where local artist Steve Appleton now runs kayaking tours – a legal activity since last year, when this two-mile stretch of the river was declared an official “recreation zone”.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“People might think it’s just a concrete dump, but the river is full of life,” he says, launching our kayaks out into the water, alarmingly close to some gurgling rapids. “We even spotted osprey here recently.”<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>As we paddle between willows, sycamores and great thickets of reeds, we glide past a group of herons sunning themselves on the concrete banks, while a school of egrets emerges from the bushes. A group of horse-riders trot along the riverbed, following the new equestrian trail to Griffith Park. It could be Vermont, if it wasn’t for the horizon of industrial sheds and electricity pylons glimpsed between the foliage. There are plenty of fish here, too: at last year’s fishing derby, someone caught a 6lb carp, and families barbecuing their catch are a regular sight here in the summer months. Perhaps they read the study which found that LA River fish are actually healthier and lower in mercury than those found in the ocean due to the clean water, which is mostly discharged from treatment plants upriver. The Narrows are crawling with watery mammals too, while the cycle lane hums with another kind of “mamil” – the middle-aged men in lycra, zooming downtown.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>This bucolic scene of riverine leisure is a far cry from the days when MacAdams tried to call attention to the river by painting himself green and impersonating river animals, summoning the spirits of the hawk, rattlesnake and frog in front of bemused audiences. “I think most people thought what we were doing was just bad art,” he admits. The LA Times agreed: “With friends like Lewis MacAdams, the Los Angeles river doesn’t need any enemies,” was their damning verdict of his debut performance.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>When we started the river clean-up I called for 10,000 people to come. Only 10 turned up. Now we’re running out of trash<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>It was an uphill struggle. “When we started the annual river clean-up, I called for 10,000 people to come,” MacAdams recalls. “Only 10 turned up.” Support gradually grew, bolstered in the 90s when Folar became the rallying point for a wave of protest against plans to turn the river into a highway. These days, thousands of Angelenos regularly show up to join in the festival atmosphere of La Gran Limpieza every spring, including the mayor. “I sometimes worry that we’re getting the river too clean,” says MacAdams with a wry smile. “We’re running out of trash.”<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>The cleanliness of the river is the least of LA’s water worries. As a sunbaked desert of impermeable concrete and tarmac, the city is slowly being dried to death. This year, California imposed emergency state-wide water use reductions for the first time in history, after another heatwave punished the parched state in the fourth year of what is said to be the worst drought in a millennium.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>“It’s a ticking time bomb,” says Ben Feldmann, principal at Mia Lehrer & Associates, the landscape architecture practice that has been working with Folar on plans for the river since 2007. “We haven’t had a Hurricane Sandy or Katrina, the kind of disaster that makes people sit up and take notice. Here it’s just a slow grind to a halt.”<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>The river, he says, can be mobilised as a crucial tool in the battle against the drought, used to retain water and recharge the aquifer. It might look like a just trickle, but the channel currently flushes a volume equivalent to the entire water needs of Long Beach (population 500,000) out into the ocean every day.<br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>Lehrer’s team produced the Los Angeles River Revitalisation Masterplan for the city in 2007, a strategic framework for how the 32-mile stretch of the river within the city limits could be reborn as an “emerald necklace”, returning it to a “continuous riparian habitat corridor” by removing the concrete and naturalising the banks where possible.<br/></td></tr>
